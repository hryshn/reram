**********Synopsys Design Compiler*********
Toggle rate specified in the tcl file sets the switching activity.
Toggle rate is the number of logic 0-1 and 1-0 transitions in 1 clocl cycle.
Default value used by DC is 0.1

>> Use dc: dc_shell-xg-t , source <.tcl file>

**********Questa Sim (verilog Simulator)*********
>> Use queta: vlog <.sv files>, vsim -novopt <name of testbench without the extension>

**********Copy files from windows to linux***********
From cygwin: (-r for copying files recursively)
 >> Use pscp: pscp -r <source_username>@<hostname>:<file location> <destination_username>@<hostname>:<file location>

**********Run compiler puma codes (dpe_compiler) on dpe_emulate***********
1. dpe_compiler (use master branch)
    a. add <net-name>.test in Makefile
    b. run net.test to generate <net***>.dpe files on src folder
    c. run generate-py_aa.sh to generate the '.npy' files in the directory structure
    d. make sure you have input files, tile instruction and core isntruction
    files in appropriate locations
    e. look at the <net> folder; n = number of tiles used - 2 (number of tiles
used is 4 if tile0, tile1, tile2 and tile3 directories get created)

2. dpe_emulate (use master branch)
    a. make sure the parameter - xbar_size  and num_ima in include/config.py are
same as used in compiler
    b. specify number of tile (compute_tiles) in include/config.py file (look
towards end)
        >> simulator needs to know how many tiles are being simulated
    c. specify the network name in src/dpe.dpy
        >> simulator needs to know where to look for instruction files
