## Introduction
This emulator was created as part of the PUMA work presented at ASPLOS 2019.

## System requirements

Below you can find the system requirements and versions tested.

| Requirement | Version                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| OS: Ubuntu  | 16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus) |
| Python      | 2.7.12                     |

## Quick Start

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-tk

sudo pip install http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu80/torch-0.3.0.post4-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl

sudo pip install -r <dpe_emulate>/requirements.txt

```

If you are behind a proxy, you should type ```
sudo pip --proxy $http_proxy install ...``` instead.

## Usage

### Emulate
For testing if everything is working fine:

```sh
cd <puma-simulator>/src

python dpe.py
```

Then, you should see some results like:

```sh
...

('Cycle: ', 8783, 'Tile halt list', [1, 1, 0, 1])
('Cycle: ', 8784, 'Tile halt list', [1, 1, 0, 1])
('Cycle: ', 8785, 'Tile halt list', [1, 1, 0, 1])
('Cycle: ', 8786, 'Tile halt list', [1, 1, 1, 1])
cycle: 8786 Node Halted
Finally node halted | PS: max_cycles 10000
('Dumping tile num: ', 0)
('Dumping tile num: ', 1)
('Dumping tile num: ', 2)
('Dumping tile num: ', 3)
Output Tile dump finished
Success: Hadrware results compiled!!
```
### Running a compiled model
This emulator executes models compiled by PUMA Compiler (https://github.com/illinois-impact/puma-compiler). 

After you compile a model using the compiler, in order to execute it with the DPE emulator, follow the steps below:

1- Copy <puma-simulator>/test/generate-py.sh and <puma-simulator>/test/input.py files to the <puma-compiler>/test folder (you only need to do this once).

2- Edit <puma-simulator>/test/generate-py.sh file, line 4 and change the value of SIMULATOR_PATH variable.
```sh

SIMULATOR_PATH="<emulator_root_path>"

```
3- Execute the generate-py.sh script

4- Look at the number of tiles generated by the compiler for ths model and update the value of "num_tile_compute" entry in <puma-simulator>/include/config.py file to match the number fo compute tiles generated by compiler (remember that Til0 and Tile1 are used for input and output)

5- Go to emulator src directory (<puma-simulator>/src) and execute dpe.py:
```sh
python2 dpe.py -n <model_name>
```
